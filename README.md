# get-opencl-headers

## Description
This script automatically fetches OpenCL header files from Khronos Group repositories to your local workspace:

* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers 
* https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP

## Usage

Fetch OpenCL headers including _cl.h_, _cl\_ext.h_, _cl\_go.h_ and so on.

```bash
sh get-opencl-headers.sh
```

Fetch cl.hpp header (for OpenCL 1.0, 1.1, 1.2) or _cl2.hpp_ (for OpenCL 2.0, 2.1), simply add an argument "--include-clhpp":

```bash
sh get-opencl-headers.sh --include-clhpp
```

**Notice:** to get the _cl.hpp_ header, **_python_** is required (some function templates in _cl.hpp_ are generated by a python script.)

## Local file structures

After fetching is done, the headers are put into `include` folder with the following structure:

```
-include
    |-CL10
    |-CL11
    |-CL12
    |-CL20
    |-CL21
    |-CL
```

The `CL` folder is a symbolic link, by default, pointing to `CL11`. You can change it based on your need. For example, if we want `CL` to link to `CL20`:

```bash
rm CL
ln -s CL20 CL
```
Therefore, in your OpenCL program, you can easily include OpenCL header file by doing the following:

```C++
#include <CL/cl.h>
```

or 

```C++
#include <CL/cl.hpp>
```
